# Databass

NOTE: Databass is a work in progress. It doesn't (yet) do anything particularly useful. 

Databass is a tool for making it easy to manage a cluster of PostgreSQL databases. Databass is a daemon and accompanying command line tools designed to allow administrators automatically deploy Postgres instances, detect and recover from failovers, and provision new slaves into already running clusters. 

## Installation

For database instances, install PostgreSQL 9.3 or later. Then,

  gem install databass

Additionally, you will need a running Zookeeper cluster. 

## Usage

It does nothing useful yet.
